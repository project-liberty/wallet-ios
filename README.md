##### The first standalone iOS XLIB wallet:

libertywallet is a standalone XLIB client. There is no server to get hacked or go down, so you can always access
your money. Using
[SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients)
mode, libertywallet connects directly to the bitcoin network with the fast
performance you need on a mobile device.

##### The next step in wallet security:

XLIB wallet is designed to protect you from malware, browser security holes,
*even physical theft*. With AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, keychain
and code signatures.

##### Beautiful simplicity:

Simplicity is XLIB wallet core design principle. A simple backup phrase is
all you need to restore your wallet on another device if yours is ever lost or
broken.  Because XLIB wallet is  
[deterministic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki),
your balance and transaction history can be recovered from just your backup
phrase.


##### Features:

- ["Simplified payment verification"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki) for fast mobile performance
- No server to get hacked or go down
- Single backup phrase that works forever
- Private keys never leave your device
- Import [password protected](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0038.mediawiki) paper wallets
- ["Payment protocol"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki) payee identity certification

##### URL scheme:

XLIB wallet supports the [x-callback-url](http://x-callback-url.com)
specification with the following URLs:

```
liberty://x-callback-url/address?x-success=myscheme://myaction
```

this will callback with the current wallet receive address: `myscheme://myaction?address=1XXXX`

the following will ask the user to authorize copying a list of their wallet
addresses to the clipbaord before calling back:

```
bread://x-callback-url/addresslist?x-success=myscheme://myaction
```

##### WARNING:

installation on jailbroken devices is strongly discouraged

Any jailbreak app can grant itself access to every other app's keychain data
and rob you by self-signing as described [here](http://www.saurik.com/id/8)
and including `<key>application-identifier</key><string>*</string>` in its
.entitlements file.

XLIB wallet is open source and available under the terms of the MIT license.
